Tumor cells prediction


Welcome to my Github Repository on showcasing predictive analytics model to determine Tumor cells as malignant or benign

Objective:
- The purpose of this repository is to learn and apply fundamental concepts of machine learning using an available dataset, and to create computational records that document the thought process. The analysis is divided into four sections: identifying the problem and data sources, exploratory data analysis, pre-processing the data, and building a model to predict whether the tumor cell tissue is malignant or benign.

Phase 1:
- focuses on identifying the types of information contained in the dataset, using Python modules to import external datasets and familiarizing oneself with the data. 

Phase 2:
- involves exploring the variables to assess how they relate to the response variable using data exploration and visualization techniques with Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

Phase 3:
- aims to find the most predictive features of the data and filter it to enhance the predictive power of the analytical model. It involves using GridSearch to determine the best model and hyperparameters before developing our predictive model.

Phase 4:
- is about constructing the predictive model to predict the diagnosis of a tumor using Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. The diagnosis of a tumor is a binary variable that is either benign or malignant. The notebook also involves evaluating the model using a confusion matrix which is essential for assessing and interpreting the fitted model.
